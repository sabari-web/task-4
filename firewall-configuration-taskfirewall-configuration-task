Cyber Security Internship â€“ Task 4 Summary
Title: Setup and Use a Firewall on Linux using UFW
Objective: Configure and test basic firewall rules to allow or block traffic on Kali Linux using UFW.
Step-by-Step Procedure with Commands
Step 1: Open the Firewall Configuration Tool (UFW)
First, check if UFW is installed and active:


sudo ufw status
If it shows Status: inactive, enable it using:

sudo ufw enable
Step 2: List Current Firewall Rules
To see all currently active rules:


sudo ufw status numbered
This displays a list of allowed/denied ports with rule numbers.

Step 3: Add a Rule to Block Inbound Traffic on Port 23 (Telnet)

sudo ufw deny 23
This blocks all incoming traffic on port 23, which is used by the insecure Telnet protocol.

To confirm the rule was added:


sudo ufw status numbered

Step 4: Test the Rule by Attempting a Telnet Connection
Install Telnet if not already installed:


sudo apt install telnet
Then test connecting to localhost on port 23:


telnet localhost 23



Step 5: Add a Rule to Allow SSH (Port 22)
SSH is essential for remote access. To allow it:


sudo ufw allow 22
To verify:


sudo ufw status numbered

Step 6: Remove the Telnet Block Rule to Restore Original State
Find the rule number for the Telnet block from status numbered. 



sudo ufw delete 1


Confirm removal:

sudo ufw status
